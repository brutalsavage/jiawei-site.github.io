I am a CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/) since 2021 Fall.

My research goal is to make software systems: **easy-to-use**, **fast** and **reliable** by improving their **programmability**, **performance** and **reliability**.

Take a look at [NNSmith](https://github.com/ise-uiuc/nnsmith), our recently released DNN synthesizer for *automatically* validating DL systems (esp. compilers).

ðŸ¤— Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:jiawei6@illinois.edu) if you are interested in my research.
