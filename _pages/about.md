I am a first-year CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/).

My primary research goal is to make future software infrastructures: **easy-to-use**, **high-performance** and **reliable**.
At present, I am developing **PLSE** techniques to make **ML Systems** reliable and efficient.

My undergrad research has been extensively related to high-performance MLSys, including model serving, tensor compilers, distributed training, ML-driven video analytics, and RL for systems.
