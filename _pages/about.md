I am a CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/) since 2021 Fall.

My primary research goal is to make future software infrastructures: **easy-to-use**, **high-performance** and **reliable**.
At present, I am developing **PLSE** techniques to make **ML Systems** reliable and efficient.

ðŸ¤— **Open to collaborate!** We should chat if you are also interested in fuzzing and building ML Systems!
