I am a CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/) since 2021 Fall.

My primary research goal is to make infrastructure software: **easy-to-use**, **fast** and **reliable**.
I am generally interested in performance, reliability and programmability in computer systems, esp. ML systems.

Specifically, I am interested in everything related to machine learning compilation such as MLIR and TVM.
I am currently building a extensible fuzzer to test any DL framework/compiler with synthesized random yet valid DNNs.

ðŸ¤— Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:jiawei6@illinois.edu) if we share common research interest.
