I am a CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/) since 2021 Fall.

My research goal is to make software systems: **easy-to-use**, **fast** and **reliable** by improving their **programmability**, **performance** and **reliability**.

Recently I am working on automating the validation of deep learning toolchains with DNN synthesis and reduction.
More generally, I am interested in program analysis/optimization, verification/validation and machine learning techniques.

ðŸ¤— Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:jiawei6@illinois.edu) if we share common research interest.
