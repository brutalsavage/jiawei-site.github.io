I am a 1st-year CS PhD student at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) advised by [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu/). I obtained my B.Eng degree from Tongji University.

My primary research goal is to make future software infrastructures: **easy-to-use**, **high-performance** and **reliable**.
At this moment, I mainly work in the intersection of **PLSE**, **Systems**, and **ML**, esp. leveraging **PLSE** techniques to make **ML Systems** reliable.

During my undergraduate study, I have been focusing on high-performance Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) research, including model serving, distributed training, ML-driven video analytics, and ML/RL for systems.
