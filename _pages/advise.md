For UIUC students, feel free to email me w/ your CV.
If you are not at UIUC, the best way to work with me is via the REU program (opens every Spring; follow updates on [@plfmse](https://twitter.com/plfmse)).
I take mentorship seriously; therefore, instead of simply assigning tasks, I will be working closely with you:

- Research and presentation.
- Modernized (open-source) software development skills.
- Recent advances in programming language, compiler, system, machine learning, etc.
- Helping you apply PhD program as if it's mine.

To know my work, check my [papers](https://jiawei-site.github.io/publications)/[blogs](https://jiawei-site.github.io/blog/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ganler).
To get a sense of my work style, feel free to reach out to previous mentees.
There are a few **constraints** to consider:
Due to availability, I only mentor a few (typically 2) students at the same time.
In addition, fluent English speaking is necessary for effective communication.
