For UIUC students, feel free to email me w/ your CV.
If you are not at UIUC, the best way to work with me is via the REU program (opens every Spring; follow updates on [@plfmse](https://twitter.com/plfmse)).
I take mentorship seriously; therefore, instead of simply assigning tasks, I will be working closely with you:

- Research and presentation.
- Modernized (open-source) software development skills.
- Recent advances in programming language, compiler, system, machine learning, etc.
- Helping you apply PhD program as if it's mine.

To know my work, check my [papers](https://jiawei-site.github.io/publications)/[blogs](https://jiawei-site.github.io/blog/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ganler).
To get a sense of my work style, feel free to reach out to previous mentees.
In general, my research style is either **go solid or go big**: (i) carefully design and build *elegant* tools for *solving real-world problems* with *guarantee*;
or (ii) exploring the *cutting-edge* problems to make *impossibles more possible*.

There are of course a few **constraints** to consider:
I only take 2 students *max* at a time for mentorship quality.
Additionally, fluent English speaking is necessary for effective communication.
