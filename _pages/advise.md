I have been fortunate to work with awesome undergrad/master students and grow together with them:

- [Yuyao Wang](https://kristoff-starling.github.io/) (Fall'22)<span style="float:right">Junior at Nanjing U</span>
- [Jinjun Peng](https://co1in.me/) (Fall'22)<span style="float:right">Tsinghua $$\to$$ **On PhD App. Admit him!**</span>
- [Sen Yang](https://github.com/syang-ng) (Smr'21)<span style="float:right">Fudan $$\to$$ Yale PhD</span>
- [Yuxiang Wei](https://yuxiang.cs.illinois.edu/) (Smr'21)<span style="float:right">Tongji $$\to$$ UIUC PhD</span>

**Working with me: How and Why?** 
I am open to collaborating with undergrad students on cool research projects.
The best way to work with me is to email me w/ your CV and (if you are not at UIUC) apply for the [REU](https://grainger.illinois.edu/research/undergraduate/reu-program) program.
I take mentorship very seriously; therefore, instead of simply assigning tasks, I will be working closely with you on things including but not limited to:

- Research and presentation.
- Modernized (open-source) software development skills.
- Knowledge in programming languages, formal methods, compilers, systems, machine learning, etc.
- Helping you apply PhD program as if it's mine.

To know my research, check out my [papers](https://jiawei-site.github.io/publications)/[blogs](https://jiawei-site.github.io/blog/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ganler).
To get a sense of my working style, feel free to reach out to my collaborators or anyone that knows me.
In general, I like carefully design and build *cool* and *elegant* tools for *solving real-world problems*. 
Therefore, if you don't appreciate *engineering efforts* and *making clean code*, you are likely to get bored working with me.

There are *ofc* a few **constraints** to consider: 
I can only take on 1-2 students at a time in order to maintain the quality of mentorship. 
Additionally, fluent English speaking/writing are necessary for effective communication.
