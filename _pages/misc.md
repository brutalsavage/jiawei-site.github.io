Digital painting and cooking are my hobbies if coding is not allowed to be taken into account.
I spent most of my spare time watching (Japanese) anime and all kinds of suspense films, and discussing interesting tech stuff with my friends.

`ganler` is the most commonly used nickname of mine, which is from my favorite animation *デュラララ!! (DURARARA!!)*.

My Chinese name is 刘佳伟.
