1. Digital painting and cooking are my hobbies if coding is not allowed to be taken into account.
2. I like spent my spare time watching (Japanese) anime and all kinds of suspense films, and discussing interesting tech stuff with my friends.
3. You may also know me as `ganler` (e.g., GitHub ID), which is from *デュラララ!! (DURARARA!!)*.
4. I like coding with good taste (if I can control) and make it (including research prototypes) usable in practice.
5. Ich kan Deutsch sprechen aber nur ein bischen. :-)
6. My Chinese name is 刘佳伟.
